In this project, I undertook the intricate task of wrangling and analysing datasets containing the tweet archive of WeRateDogs. Renowned for its humorous dog ratings, this Twitter account, under the handle @dog_rates, captivates audiences with its witty comments and unconventional rating system. Through rigorous analysis, I uncovered intriguing revelations. The majority of dog rating tweets featured a single image, while a small percentage showcased multiple images, with those containing four images garnering the highest engagement in terms of retweets and favourites. Further exploration revealed the most prominent dog breeds in WeRateDogs tweets, with Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, Pembrokes, Chihuahuas, and Pugs stealing the spotlight. These breeds made up 23% of the featured dogs, captivating audiences with their charm and charisma. Moreover, a typical dog rating on WeRateDogs falls within the range of 10/10 to 13/10, reflecting the account's unwavering appreciation for canine excellence. In unravelling the mysteries of WeRateDogs, I unleashed a wealth of insights into the captivating world of dog rating culture...[See full project.](https://github.com/abdulwasiuabdulraheem/twitter-archive-data-wrangling-udacity/blob/main/wrangle_act.ipynb)

In the heart of Seattle's dynamic real estate market, my mission was clear: <b>to uncover the driving forces behind house prices</b>. Square footage emerged as the star player in this narrative, boasting the strongest correlation with price. But the story didn't end there. As I delved deeper, other factors emerged. House condition, grade, and waterfront status all played roles, with grade standing out for its significant impact on price. For my presentation, I focused squarely on square footage. I highlighted its importance, showcasing patterns in its distribution and the transformed scatterplot, a clear demonstration of its influence on house prices.
In the end, my findings painted a straightforward picture: in Seattle's housing market, size matters. And armed with this knowledge, buyers and sellers alike could navigate the market with confidence, knowing the true value of every square foot...

Embarking on an investigative journey into a dataset of 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil, I sought to unravel the factors influencing appointment show-up rates. My objectives were to dissect the impact of various factors such as SMS reminders, diabetes status, and gender disparities, particularly regarding hypertension prevalence. The findings revealed compelling insights. While the overall show-up rate stood at 79.8%, patients who didn't receive SMS reminders exhibited a higher attendance rate compared to those who did. Additionally, individuals with diabetes displayed a slightly higher show-up rate, suggesting a nuanced relationship between health status and appointment adherence. Gender dynamics also surfaced prominently, with females comprising 65% of the sample and exhibiting a higher prevalence of hypertension compared to males. This disparity underscores the importance of tailored healthcare interventions to address specific demographic needs. In essence, this investigation not only sheds light on appointment attendance trends but also underscores the multifaceted interplay of health factors and demographic variables in shaping healthcare outcomes...
