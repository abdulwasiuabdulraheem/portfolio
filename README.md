# MY PORTFOLIO HIGHLIGHTS

## Empowering PalyRA's Financial Future Through Predictive Loan Repayment Models 
![classifiers](https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ai-loans.png)
PalyRA, a short-term loan provider, grapples with persistent bad debt, recovering only 65% of loans in the past year. This jeopardises its operations, prompting management to devise a solution. A pivotal aspect of their strategy involves employing a data scientist to develop a predictive model for loan repayment. Tasked with this endeavour, I  gathered PalyRA's historical data, which contains information about past loans. Donning my data scientist's mantle, I delved into building alternative machine learning models aimed at predicting loan repayment defaults. This initiative seeks to reshape PalyRA's trajectory within the finance sector, fortifying its resilience against default risks.  By leveraging advanced analytics and predictive algorithms, the model aspires to mitigate bad debt occurrences, bolstering PalyRA's financial stability. Through this concerted effort, PalyRA endeavours to transcend its current challenges and chart a path towards sustainable growth and success in the competitive landscape of short-term lending....[See full project.](https://github.com/abdulwasiuabdulraheem/The-Best-Classifier/blob/main/The_Best_Classifier.ipynb) 

## WeRateDogs Tweets' Data Wrangling and Analysis

In this project, I undertook the intricate task of wrangling and analysing datasets containing the tweet archive of WeRateDogs. It is an extremely messy and dirty data. Renowned for its humorous dog ratings, this Twitter account, under the handle @dog_rates, captivates audiences with its witty comments and unconventional rating system. Through rigorous analysis, I discovered some interesting facts about WeRateDogs tweets. The majority of dog rating tweets featured a single image, while a small percentage showcased multiple images, with those containing four images garnering the highest engagement in terms of Retweets and Likes. Further exploration showed that the most prominent dog breeds in WeRateDogs tweets are Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, Pembrokes, Chihuahuas, and Pugs. These breeds collectively constituted about 23% of the featured dogs, captivating audiences with their charm and charisma. Also, a typical dog rating on WeRateDogs falls within the range of 10/10 to 13/10. Yes, you read that correctly: 10/10 to <b>13/10</b>...[See full project.](https://github.com/abdulwasiuabdulraheem/twitter-archive-data-wrangling-udacity/blob/main/wrangle_act.ipynb)  

## Seattle's Housing Market: How the Features of a House Influence Its Price

The objective of the Seattle's Housing Market's project is to understand which feature(s) of a house in Seattle determines its price. The square footage of the house emerged as the most likely determinant, showing the strongest correlation with price. As I delved deeper, other factors appeared to also influence price. The house condition (good or bad), grade attached to the house, and the presence or absence of a waterfront all played roles, with grade standing out for its significant impact on price. Informed by the preliminary analysis, I zoomed in on square footage. I highlighted its importance by providing a clear demonstration of its greater influence on house prices.
In the end, my findings painted a straightforward picture: in Seattle's housing market, size matters. But... [See full project.](https://github.com/abdulwasiuabdulraheem/House-Sales-Data-Exploration/blob/main/Part_I_exploration.ipynb)

## Understanding Medical Appointment Attendance in Brazil

In this data analytics project, I sought to unravel the factors influencing medical appointment show-up rates in Brazil. The objective was to dissect the impact of various factors such as SMS reminders, diabetes status, hypertension, and gender. The findings revealed compelling insights. While the overall show-up rate stood at 79.8%, patients who didn't receive SMS reminders exhibited a higher attendance rate compared to those who did. Additionally, individuals with diabetes displayed a slightly higher show-up rate, suggesting a nuanced relationship between health status and appointment adherence. Gender dynamics also surfaced prominently, with females comprising higher percentage of the total attendance and exhibiting a higher prevalence of hypertension compared to males...

## Detection of Flower Species
![Flowers](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*rhP_m_pskOF_MUad)

In this AI/Machine Learning project, I developed an app capable of identifying various species of flowers. My primary objective was to train an image classifier to accurately recognise different flower species, paving the way for a user-friendly application. The first step in this endeavour involved loading and preprocessing a comprehensive image dataset containing labelled images of various flower species. With the dataset in hand, I meticulously trained the image classifier, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy and efficiency. Through countless iterations and fine-tuning, the image classifier reached a level of proficiency where it could effectively distinguish between different flower species...
