In the heart of Seattle's dynamic real estate market, my mission was clear: <b>to uncover the driving forces behind house prices</b>. Square footage emerged as the star player in this narrative, boasting the strongest correlation with price. But the story didn't end there. As I delved deeper, other factors emerged. House condition, grade, and waterfront status all played roles, with grade standing out for its significant impact on price. For my presentation, I focused squarely on square footage. I highlighted its importance by providing a clear demonstration of its influence on house prices.
In the end, my findings painted a straightforward picture: in Seattle's housing market, size matters. And armed with this knowledge, buyers and sellers alike could navigate the market with confidence...

In this project, I undertook the intricate task of wrangling and analysing datasets containing the tweet archive of WeRateDogs. Renowned for its humorous dog ratings, this Twitter account, under the handle @dog_rates, captivates audiences with its witty comments and unconventional rating system. Through rigorous analysis, I uncovered intriguing revelations. The majority of dog rating tweets featured a single image, while a small percentage showcased multiple images, with those containing four images garnering the highest engagement in terms of retweets and favourites. Further exploration revealed the most prominent dog breeds in WeRateDogs tweets, with Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, Pembrokes, Chihuahuas, and Pugs stealing the spotlight. These breeds made up 23% of the featured dogs, captivating audiences with their charm and charisma. Moreover, a typical dog rating on WeRateDogs falls within the range of 10/10 to 13/10, reflecting the account's unwavering appreciation for canine excellence. In unravelling the mysteries of WeRateDogs, I unleashed a wealth of insights into the captivating world of dog rating culture...[See full project.](https://github.com/abdulwasiuabdulraheem/twitter-archive-data-wrangling-udacity/blob/main/wrangle_act.ipynb)  

## Understanding Medical Appointment Attendance in Brazil

In this data analytics project, I sought to unravel the factors influencing medical appointment show-up rates in Brazil. My objectives were to dissect the impact of various factors such as SMS reminders, diabetes status, and gender disparities, particularly regarding hypertension prevalence. The findings revealed compelling insights. While the overall show-up rate stood at 79.8%, patients who didn't receive SMS reminders exhibited a higher attendance rate compared to those who did. Additionally, individuals with diabetes displayed a slightly higher show-up rate, suggesting a nuanced relationship between health status and appointment adherence. Gender dynamics also surfaced prominently, with females comprising 65% of the sample and exhibiting a higher prevalence of hypertension compared to males. This disparity underscores the importance of tailored healthcare interventions to address specific demographic needs. In essence, this investigation not only sheds light on appointment attendance trends but also underscores the multifaceted interplay of health factors and demographic variables in shaping healthcare outcomes...

## Predicting Loan Repayment
![classifiers](https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ai-loans.png)
For this mini project, I tackled the task of developing a classifier to predict whether a loan will be paid off or not. Beginning with the loading and cleaning of a historical dataset containing loan application data, I meticulously prepared the data for analysis. Employing a variety of classification algorithms, including k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression, I explored different approaches to modelling loan repayment outcomes. Each algorithm was carefully evaluated for its accuracy and performance using key metrics such as the Jaccard index, F1-score, and LogLoss. The results of the analysis were reported comprehensively, providing insights into the efficacy of each classifier in predicting loan repayment. By examining the accuracy and performance of the models across multiple metrics, I gained valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of each algorithm...[See full project.](https://github.com/abdulwasiuabdulraheem/The-Best-Classifier/blob/main/The_Best_Classifier.ipynb) 

## Detection of Flower Species
![Flowers](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*rhP_m_pskOF_MUad)

In this AI/Machine Learning project, I developed an app capable of identifying various species of flowers. My primary objective was to train an image classifier to accurately recognise different flower species, paving the way for a user-friendly application. The first step in this endeavour involved loading and preprocessing a comprehensive image dataset containing labelled images of various flower species. With the dataset in hand, I meticulously trained the image classifier, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy and efficiency. Through countless iterations and fine-tuning, the image classifier reached a level of proficiency where it could effectively distinguish between different flower species...
